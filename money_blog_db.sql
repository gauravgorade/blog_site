From swimming with exotic fishes, sailing through lush mangroves, to relaxing on pristine, golden beaches, you are bound to find something that will attract you to the Saudi coasts. Let\'s have a look at 6 experiences that will bring you back to Saudi again and again.', '<p><strong>1. Scuba Diving Along the Red Sea</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong><img class=\"lazy\" src=\"https://seoimgak.mmtcdn.com/blog/sites/default/files/images/scuba_2.jpg\" alt=\"scuba\" /></strong></p>\r\n<p>Sea activities like scuba diving can make any holiday memorable! In Saudi Arabia, scuba diving in the Red Sea allows you to swim amongst nearly 1,200 species of fish, almost 20 per cent of which are unique to the area. Explore the coral reefs and discover the ruins and treasures of shipwrecks from throughout history.</p>\r\n<p><strong>2. Explore the Farasan Islands</strong></p>\r\n<p>Some parts of the world are home to stunning natural ecosystems. Explore the rich history and marine life while sailing through the azure waters and mangroves of the Farasan Islands. Check out manta rays, whale sharks, dolphins and sea turtles in the bays and inlets of the island. Step ashore and lose yourself in the depths of the Al-Qandal forest, visit Al-Qassar village and the islands\' past as a Roman garrison, the furthest outpost of the empire.</p>\r\n<p><strong>3. Kiteboard in Jeddah</strong></p>\r\n<p>Take advantage of soft, sandy beaches, clear, shallow waters, and consistent year-round winds when kiteboarding off the coast of Jeddah.

(2, 16, '9', 'A Road Trip to the Heart of India: Madhya Pradesh', 'Four families travelling in four cars for 4000 kilometres for 14 days. An impossible journey, some might say. But here we were, taking a road trip to magical Madhya Pradesh or the ‘Heart of India’.', '<p><strong>Madhya Pradesh - The Heart of India</strong></p>\r\n<p>Madhya Pradesh (MP) happens to be one of my home states. It has plenty of things to offer &ndash; forts and palaces (Maheshwar, Gwalior &amp; Orchha), jungles ((Panna, Ken, Kanha, Satpuda &amp; Bhimbetka), temples (Khajuraho, Datia &amp; Maihar), hills (Pachmarhi), rivers (Narmada &amp; Ken) and lakes (Bhopal). And this was just where we travelled! However, there is much more to Madhya Pradesh than this.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>In Madhya Pradesh, there is always something interesting to see every 200-400 kilometres: and it is best to explore the region in your own vehicle. Driving allows you the freedom of time and movement (something that a train may not be able to do). Moreover, the airports are not always close to your intended destination, so you will end up hiring a car. So, it is better to opt for a road trip. Most roads in the state are in good condition. Some sections are exceptionally well developed &ndash; the national and state highways that you will use are mostly well made. However, there are sections where work is going on to make them wider or better. This leads to diversions currently, which can make driving somewhat tedious. Hopefully, once the new roads are built, driving around will become easier.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>So, now that you know the best way to explore Madhya Pradesh, let&rsquo;s check out the itinerary!&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Where to Go</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong><img class=\"lazy\" src=\"https://seoimgak.mmtcdn.com/blog/sites/default/files/images/970x587-blog-Itinerary.jpg\" alt=\"itinerary\" width=\"970\" height=\"587\" /></strong></p>\r\n<p>In the next sections, we will let photos tell the story.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Maheshwar:</em></strong>&nbsp;The Shiv Panchayat, the&nbsp;<em>tani-bani</em>&nbsp;sarees, the history of the fort and Ahalya Bai make this an interesting short detour on the way to Indore from Mumbai. Both Wikipedia and local guides say that this place was earlier called Mahishmati (so all you fans of Bahubali&mdash;go see where the history actually began).</p>\r\n<p><img class=\"lazy\" src=\"https://seoimgak.mmtcdn.com/blog/sites/default/files/images/970x587-blog-Maheshwar.jpg\" alt=\"maheshwar\" width=\"970\" height=\"587\" /></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Indore:</em></strong>&nbsp;We missed exploring the historical landmarks as we had camped in the city for both legs of our trip as the anchor destination. We had long drives coming into Indore both times. So all that we explored were the eateries at Chappan Dukan. The city and some of its surrounding areas have a lot more to offer. Since we can always come back here more easily, in a long MP trip, Indore remained underexplored.</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Bhopal:</em></strong>&nbsp;The City of Lakes has a fantastic evening experience to offer in its speedboats (which is what we took) and cruises. Keep traffic in mind while reaching the boarding point, but once you are in the speedboat and can see the sun setting in the waters of the lake, the experience will be worth the effort. If you have time (we left Indore late, but you could reach Bhopal earlier in the day), definitely visit the tribal museum&mdash;<em>Manav Sanghrahalaya</em>.</p>\r\n<p><img class=\"lazy\" src=\"https://seoimgak.mmtcdn.com/blog/sites/default/files/images/970x587-blog-boatinginbhopal.jpg\" alt=\"bhopal\" width=\"970\" height=\"587\" /></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Sanchi:&nbsp;</em></strong>This was the first of the three UNESCO World Heritage sites in MP that we explored. Find a good guide and you can happily spend hours learning about the history of the Ashokan era. For us, time just flew! One popular photo location is the angle from where the imprint on the new Rs. 200 note has been taken. If you are there, don&rsquo;t miss the location.</p>\r\n<p><img class=\"lazy\" src=\"https://seoimgak.mmtcdn.com/blog/sites/default/files/images/970x587-blog-sanchistupa.jpg\" alt=\"sanchi\" width=\"970\" height=\"587\" /></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Bhimbetka:</em></strong>&nbsp;We came to the second world heritage site in a day! Again, a good guide can help you get up-to-date with some fascinating history of humanity, going back tens of thousands of years and some very beautiful scenes to shoot. Remember you will be walking a lot at both Sanchi and Bhimbetka. Plan for that too.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>You can&rsquo;t plan for a trip to Madhya Pradesh and not talk about its food! Indore is famous worldwide for its spicy, delicious, lip-smacking dishes. There is no better way to experience it all than at Chappan Dukan and its stalls. Especially on a wintry night, the hot&nbsp;<em>garadus</em>,&nbsp;<em>bhutte ka kees</em>&nbsp;and the cheesy potato spirals are a delight. Top that up with&nbsp;<em>thandai</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>paan&nbsp;</em>and you will be in your own foodie heaven.</p>\r\n<p>At Gwalior, Taj Usha Kiran is the place to visit and stay. If you love spicy food, try the Nepalese-Marathi cuisine there and the vegetable dish with 18 spices! You will be amazed to find fantastic continental, tribal, Indian, and global cuisines in the middle of the Kanha jungle at the Pugdundee Resort. They can arrange for such a fabulous outdoor dining arrangement. At Panchmarhi, you can enjoy a chilly night with melodious and lively live music. The food experience at the WelcomHeritage Golf View in Panchmarhi is simply divine.</p>\r\n<p>Lest you think you need to be budget-conscious or stay at top-end hotels to get good food, you will be mistaken. All the eateries that we stopped at had hot, authentic Indian food for all ages and palates&ndash;&nbsp;<em>dhabas</em>&nbsp;at Maihar and Katni, the food court at Dodi (between Bhopal and Indore), and the Badri Seth Marwadi Bhoj and Raja Caf&eacute; at Khajurao.</p>\r\n<p>The one thing you can relax about on your trip to MP is the food. The heart of the country takes its taste palate very seriously!&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Some Driving Tips</strong></p>\r\n<p>Google Maps works in almost all places. However, it is best to call ahead and ask which route to take. For example, on the way to Pachmarhi), there were two routes &ndash; one ended up being a dead-end. Similarly, the routes in and out of Kanha required some help from the local resort. Otherwise, maps work fine in the cities.</p>\r\n<p>We had a couple of instances with the potholes too. A pothole just before the last toll while entering Gwalior caused a rear tyre of a car to burst (not just puncture), and at Seoni (on the drive from Kanha to Pachmarhi), a pothole caused a car to slam the brakes suddenly, leading to an accident with the car behind. In both cases, there were no injuries or damage to any luggage. However, the cars took some beating. Thankfully, locals were cooperative and the car helplines worked. The experience can be traumatic, especially if it happens late at night.</p>\r\n<p>In many places, the parking capacity cannot handle the tourist rush. Maihar and Dhuadhaar Falls are two key examples. In Kanha and Pachmarhi, you will end up driving in the local Gypsy car most of the time (though in Pachmarhi, you can access many sightseeing points without needing a Gypsy car).&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>This one is not so much a driving tip as a routing one. We could have chosen to travel to Jhansi instead of Gwalior (or along with Gwalior). If we had a couple of days more, we could have planned a stop at Amarkantak &ndash; the origin point of Narmada. We missed Mandu, Omkareshwar, Udaygiri and other more famous spots in MP. Depending on your interest, you can plan to include some of these places in your itinerary.</p>\r\n<p>The best part of the driving for us was that we had four cars and had four families with us. This meant we could spend a lot of time with each other at every location. In this day and age of WhatsApp calls, it is not a road trip if the passengers don&rsquo;t dial in each other in a group call and play a<em>ntakshari</em>!</p>\r\n<p><strong>Hurrah, Madhya Pradesh!</strong></p>\r\n<p>MP has typically been one of the most underrated places when it comes to local Indian tourism. I hope you take this road &ndash; it is a charming one, which will offer you a wide variety of choices and memories of a lifetime!</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>', ' ', '1649799246-mp.jpg', '1649799246-mp1.jpg', 'a-road-trip-to-the-heart-of-india-madhya-pradesh', '2022-04-13', 1, 1, NULL, '2022-04-13 03:04:06', 15),

The stunning mangroves are a sight &amp;ndash; sitting 15-feet tall, with their long root system that seems to &amp;lsquo;snorkel&amp;rsquo; out of the saltwater for air. To get a closer look, you can sign up for one of the night tours and explore the mangroves by gliding through the waters after dark.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4.

An unforgettable experience here is the evening desert safari where travellers can go on a 4x4 dune escape and then watch a traditional tanura belly dance show and cap the night with stargazing!&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Discover the Historical Treasures&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;The walled compound in the west part of Abu Dhabi is home to a collection of magnificent governmental buildings. Visitors can take guided tours that afford highlights of Arabic literature in the Qasr Al Watan Library, the mosaics of The Great Hall, the artefacts and scrolls in the House of Knowledge and the stunning Presidential Palace - Qasr Al Watan.&amp;nbsp; Visitors can taste the royal lifestyle, by checking in at the neighbouring Emirates Palace, a lavish hotel that is set within acres of landscaped gardens.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6.

Unleash ideas within you</strong></h2>\r\n<p>If you want to&nbsp;create a blog, you don&rsquo;t need a revolutionary idea. But, your blog should be focused on something specific.</p>\r\n<p>Remember that no idea is&nbsp;<em>truly&nbsp;</em>unique, no matter how good it is.</p>\r\n<p>But you have unique&nbsp;<em>experiences</em>. You have a distinct voice. And you probably have a vibrant personality that will attract others who want to hear about your experiences.</p>\r\n<p>When it comes to choosing your blog&rsquo;s niche, there are two key questions to ask yourself.</p>\r\n<h3><strong>1. Do I Enjoy Learning About This Topic?</strong></h3>\r\n<p>If you don&rsquo;t love the topic, it&rsquo;ll show in your writing. You shouldn&rsquo;t even&nbsp;<a href=\"https://neilpatel.com/blog/outsource-blog/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">start a blog</a>&nbsp;if you don&rsquo;t love what you&rsquo;re&nbsp;<a href=\"https://neilpatel.com/blog/blogging-formula/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">blogging about.</a></p>\r\n<p>Whatever topic you pick, you need to love it and be naturally curious about it.</p>\r\n<p>If not,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://neilpatel.com/blog/how-to-never-run-out-of-blog-post-ideas/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">you&rsquo;ll run out of ideas quickly</a>. You&rsquo;ll lose any momentum you built up at the start.</p>\r\n<p>Most importantly, you won&rsquo;t be able to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://neilpatel.com/blog/blogging-consistently/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">consistently create content</a>&nbsp;that will build your audience.</p>\r\n<p>If you are still lost, think about&nbsp;what sort of things people come to you for advice on. Do friends or family ask you for fitness tips? Recipe ideas? Career advice? You know what you can best speak to.</p>\r\n<h3><strong>2. Are Others Interested in The Same Things?</strong></h3>\r\n<p>You might feel like the only 20-something who&rsquo;s obsessed with knitting. But there are others out there.</p>\r\n<p>Do a quick Google search and you&rsquo;ll find over 1 million results aimed at people just like you.</p>\r\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img class=\"wp-image-145257\" src=\"https://neilpatel.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/young-knitters-search-how-to-start-a-blog.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" srcset=\"https://neilpatel.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/young-knitters-search-how-to-start-a-blog.png 700w, https://neilpatel.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/young-knitters-search-how-to-start-a-blog-350x210.png 350w\" alt=\"Young knitters Google search for How to Start a Blog\" width=\"700\" height=\"420\" /></figure>\r\n<p>You might be wondering if your idea is too quirky. Or, is it too broad? My advice is to get as focused as you can on something you&rsquo;re genuinely interested in.</p>\r\n<p>If you want to start a travel blog, for example, stay away from generic words like &ldquo;travel.&rdquo; Choose a more specific topic, like &ldquo;backpacking.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<h2 id=\"step-2\">Step 2. Choose a name for your new blog</h2>\r\n<p>Now for the fun part: naming your blog.</p>\r\n<p>This is your brand. It&rsquo;s how people will remember you.</p>\r\n<p>But don&rsquo;t overthink it. The magic of a brand gets built over time. Even if you feel stuck, keep moving forward.</p>\r\n<p>The best way to land on the perfect name is to start with brainstorming. In the last step, we talked about unleashing all of your ideas and nailing down your niche.</p>\r\n<p>Now, it&rsquo;s time to take those ideas and turn them into a name.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>So, open up a new spreadsheet or grab a pen and paper. Then spend about ten minutes writing down every word that comes to mind.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>From there, start combining words and phrases until something stands out to you. Aim for 5 &ndash; 10 potential names and write them down.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Now, it&rsquo;s time to see if those names are available as domains. A domain is where your blog lives on the internet.</p>\r\n<p>As an example, neilpatel.com is my domain.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Neil Patel is who I am, but it&rsquo;s also my brand and what you type into the address bar to find me. But that also means you can&rsquo;t use the domain because I already own it.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>You&nbsp;<em>could&nbsp;</em>do what I did and use your personal name as your domain.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>But in most cases, I recommend choosing a different name for your blog.

It&rsquo;s much easier than it sounds.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>To get started, you need web hosting (where your blog lives) and a domain name (your blog&rsquo;s address). The good news is that&nbsp;<a href=\"https://neilpatel.com/go/np0542/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Hostinger</a>, my favorite web hosting company, offers both as a package deal.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<div class=\"a1c85ac3 _9bd02324\">\r\n<div class=\"e5719e3b\">\r\n<div class=\"d9de5014\">\r\n<figure class=\"_7cb37961\"><a href=\"https://neilpatel.com/go/np0542/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://neilpatel.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/hostinger-logo.png\" alt=\"Hostinger\" width=\"250\" height=\"250\" /></a></figure>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"_1dbf48e5\">\r\n<h3 class=\"d951d4b9\"><a href=\"https://neilpatel.com/go/np0542/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Hostinger</a></h3>\r\n<h4 class=\"d951d4b10\">Best Web Hosting</h4>\r\n<p class=\"_4ccf1904\">Get rock-solid web hosting at a steal of a price.

Plus, you can lock in that rate for four whole years!</p>\r\n<div class=\"cd35f914\"><a class=\"_2789f5c9\" href=\"https://neilpatel.com/go/np0542/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Start today!</a></div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>Plus, it&rsquo;s incredibly affordable.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Head over to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://neilpatel.com/go/np0542/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Hostinger</a>&nbsp;and click &ldquo;Start Now.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Next, you&rsquo;ll see four different plans. Scroll down and select the WordPress Starter plan for $3.99/month.

Or, you can start from scratch by clicking the text link at the bottom. If you&rsquo;re new to this, though, I&rsquo;d recommend starting with a template. There are a lot of gorgeously designed options to choose from.</p>\r\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img class=\"wp-image-143365\" src=\"https://neilpatel.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/hostinger-select-template-how-to-start-a-blog.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" srcset=\"https://neilpatel.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/hostinger-select-template-how-to-start-a-blog.png 700w, https://neilpatel.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/hostinger-select-template-how-to-start-a-blog-350x210.png 350w\" alt=\"Hostinger setup select template How to Start a Blog\" width=\"700\" height=\"420\" /></figure>\r\n<p>Once you&rsquo;ve made a decision there, you&rsquo;ll be able to buy a new domain or connect an existing one to your site.</p>\r\n<p>This will be easy since you already searched for available domains in Step 2.

Without it, anyone can access your phone number, home address, and email.</p>\r\n<p>You still own the domain name, but your contact information is protected against scam callers and unsolicited mail.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s certainly worth the extra investment.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>After that, you&rsquo;re done with the hardest part!&nbsp;<strong><em>Congrats on your new blog!</em></strong></p>\r\n<p>It will take just a few minutes for Hostinger to finish setting up your site. Stay on the screen until , you&rsquo;re ready to move on to the next step.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2 id=\"step-4\"><strong>Step 4. Get Familiar with WordPress, Your Blogging Software</strong></h2>\r\n<p>You can&rsquo;t start a blog without blogging software. I run all of my blogs on WordPress because it&rsquo;s user-friendly, free, and powerful.</p>\r\n<p>If you decide to make a blog that&rsquo;s not on WordPress, you&rsquo;ll find that it is much more costly. WordPress offers a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://neilpatel.com/blog/free-wordpress-plugins/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">ton of free plugins</a>&nbsp;that allow you to modify your blog in any way, shape, or form.</p>\r\n<p>What&rsquo;s nice is that Hostinger takes care of WordPress installation for you during setup. You don&rsquo;t have to do anything to get it ready to use.</p>\r\n<p>After the Hostinger setup wizard is finished, you&rsquo;ll be greeted with a screen where you can connect your domain, view your site, or head to the WordPress dashboard or the Hostinger control panel.</p>\r\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img class=\"wp-image-143370\" src=\"https://neilpatel.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/hostinger-completed-setup-how-to-start-a-blog.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" srcset=\"https://neilpatel.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/hostinger-completed-setup-how-to-start-a-blog.png 700w, https://neilpatel.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/hostinger-completed-setup-how-to-start-a-blog-350x210.png 350w\" alt=\"Hostinger completed setup for How to Start a Blog\" width=\"700\" height=\"420\" /></figure>\r\n<p>Click &ldquo;Manage WordPress&rdquo; and you&rsquo;ll be taken to that section in hPanel.

Design Your Blog With a WordPress Theme</strong></h2>\r\n<p>In the blogging world, pre-built&nbsp;<a href=\"https://neilpatel.com/blog/32-free-wordpress-themes-for-effective-content-marketing/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">WordPress site designs are called themes</a>.</p>\r\n<p>Out of the box, your WordPress blog will look something like this:</p>\r\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img class=\"wp-image-128710\" src=\"https://neilpatel.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/WordPress-blank-site-how-to-start-a-blog-700x515.webp\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" srcset=\"https://neilpatel.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/WordPress-blank-site-how-to-start-a-blog-700x515.webp 700w, https://neilpatel.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/WordPress-blank-site-how-to-start-a-blog-350x258.webp 350w, https://neilpatel.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/WordPress-blank-site-how-to-start-a-blog-768x565.webp 768w, https://neilpatel.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/WordPress-blank-site-how-to-start-a-blog.webp 1069w\" alt=\"New blank WordPress site for How to Start a Blog\" width=\"700\" height=\"515\" /></figure>\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s the simple foundation you start with. But you&rsquo;re going to want to find something that fits with your name, brand, and the experience you want readers to have.</p>\r\n<p>There are thousands of themes to choose from. But it can be easy to get trapped in &ldquo;shiny object syndrome&rdquo;, browsing through tons of pretty pictures and templates but not walking away with a theme that fits your needs.</p>\r\n<p>You can swap out your theme any time, so choose something that&rsquo;s good enough for now rather than stressing over the perfect option. Like your brand, your WordPress blog&rsquo;s theme will probably evolve over time as you figure out what works and looks best in practice.</p>\r\n<p>Let&rsquo;s go through selecting a theme step by step.</p>\r\n<p>First, you need to log into your WordPress admin.

What are you going to write about in your blog?</p>\r\n<p>Let&rsquo;s find out.</p>\r\n<h2 id=\"step-7\"><strong>Step 7. Brainstorm Blog Topics</strong></h2>\r\n<p>On the technical side, your blog is all set up and ready to go. When it comes to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://neilpatel.com/blog/generate-content-ideas/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">topic generation</a>, the world is your oyster.</p>\r\n<p>The majority of your blog posts will come from personal experiences, passions, successes, failures, and new learnings.</p>\r\n<p>People use questions as search queries, like:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>What should I write about?</li>\r\n<li>What to blog about?</li>\r\n<li>Should I start blogging?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>So naturally, you should start off with some questions of your own. I use a series of questions and a systematic process to come up with my blog topic ideas.</p>\r\n<p>No need to worry. It&rsquo;s not complicated and it won&rsquo;t take very much time.</p>\r\n<p>By following this process, you should be able to come up with about 50 working topics within a half hour of distraction-free time.</p>\r\n<p>Pull out a pen and paper or open up your favorite word processing tool.</p>\r\n<p>The goal of this exercise is to get 10 answers for each question. If you can think of more, note them all.</p>\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s time to look through the lens of your readers with these 5 questions.</p>\r\n<h3><strong>1. &ldquo;What Excites, Intrigues, or Stirs Passion in My Readers?&rdquo;</strong></h3>\r\n<p>Examples:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>As a golfer, I get excited by hitting my driver farther. I&rsquo;m fascinated by mental performance. I&rsquo;m passionate about healthy living.</li>\r\n<li>As a new stay-at-home mom, I get excited by budget-friendly ideas for the family. I&rsquo;m intrigued by sleep-training. I&rsquo;m passionate about homeschooling.</li>\r\n<li>As an avid camper, I get excited about finding undervalued camping sites. I&rsquo;m intrigued by survival tactics. I&rsquo;m passionate about minimalist living.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3><strong>2. &ldquo;What Common Challenges Do My Readers Face?&rdquo;</strong></h3>\r\n<p>Examples:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Golfers might struggle with slicing the ball.</li>\r\n<li>Stay-at-home moms may find meal planning challenging.</li>\r\n<li>Campers might struggle with packing light.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3><strong>3. &ldquo;What Character Traits Do My Readers Possess?</strong></h3>\r\n<p>Example:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Serious golfers have emotional stability.</li>\r\n<li>Moms are patient and have a sense of humor.</li>\r\n<li>Campers are adventurous and resourceful.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3><strong>4. &ldquo;What Do My Readers Love About My Niche?&rdquo;</strong></h3>\r\n<p>Example:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Golfers love the challenge of perfection.</li>\r\n<li>Stay-at-home moms love being a part of their child&rsquo;s mental, physical and emotional development.</li>\r\n<li>Campers love time away from the busy city life.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3><strong>5. &ldquo;What Do My Readers Hate About My Niche?&rdquo;</strong></h3>\r\n<p>Examples:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Golfers hate playing with partners who complain all day long.</li>\r\n<li>Stay-at-home moms hate being looked down on by others.</li>\r\n<li>Campers hate getting eaten alive.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>You get the point. Now that you have about 50 answers, you can begin dissecting blog post ideas from each answer. The sky is the limit.</p>\r\n<p>Here are a few examples you can extract from one answer in your list:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Cure Your Slice: The Foolproof Guide To Hit The Fairway Every Time</li>\r\n<li>3 Reasons Why You&rsquo;re Slicing The Ball And One Stupid Simple Fix</li>\r\n<li>Never Slice Again: 9 Drills To Play Like The Pros</li>\r\n<li>7 Training Aids For Dead Straight Ball Flight</li>\r\n<li>How To Shoot Even Par With A Nasty Slice.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Try to come up with a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://neilpatel.com/blog/the-step-by-step-guide-to-writing-powerful-headlines/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">catchy headline that will draw your readers</a>&nbsp;in and then throw them a one-two punch in the rest of your content.</p>\r\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\">\r\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\r\n<div class=\"rll-youtube-player\" data-src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/wDuL4N1Gi5g\" data-id=\"wDuL4N1Gi5g\" data-query=\"feature=oembed\">\r\n<div data-id=\"wDuL4N1Gi5g\" data-query=\"feature=oembed\" data-src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/wDuL4N1Gi5g\"><img src=\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wDuL4N1Gi5g/sddefault.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" /><button class=\"play\" aria-label=\"play Youtube video\"></button></div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</figure>\r\n<h2 id=\"step-8\"><strong>Step 8.

Create an Editorial Calendar</strong></h2>\r\n<p>One of the fatal mistakes I see bloggers make is to blog only when they &ldquo;feel like it.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>They forget that new fans want more content and they fail to deliver.</p>\r\n<p>Unforeseen circumstances will arise. You&rsquo;ll let a new Netflix series take over the time that you could have spent blogging.</p>\r\n<p>Life will continue to throw curveballs at you, whether you start blogging or not.</p>\r\n<p>Consistency is undervalued and it needs to be something you prioritize.</p>\r\n<p>I&rsquo;ve written over a thousand articles and it&rsquo;s not because I type 7,000 words per minute.</p>\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s because I&nbsp;<a href=\"https://neilpatel.com/blog/create-editorial-calendar/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">follow an editorial calendar without compromise.</a></p>\r\n<p>Schedules aren&rsquo;t just for big publications like The New York Times and the Huffington Post. They&rsquo;re for regular people like you and me.</p>\r\n<p>Think about it like this.</p>\r\n<p>If you have a doctor&rsquo;s appointment in your calendar or even a lunch date with a friend, you&rsquo;re going to honor it. Worst case scenario, you&rsquo;ll reschedule for the next available time-slot.</p>\r\n<p>Editorial calendars work in a similar fashion.</p>\r\n<p>They make aggressive goals reachable in micro-steps. They keep you organized. They streamline your social media and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://neilpatel.com/blog/beginners-guide-email-marketing/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">email marketing efforts</a>.</p>\r\n<p>And, you&rsquo;ll be surprised at how an editorial calendar can even help you grow in character and integrity.</p>\r\n<p>We are creatures of habit.</p>\r\n<p>The better you keep your dates, the faster you&rsquo;ll grow your audience.</p>\r\n<p>So, how do you get started and how much will it cost?</p>\r\n<p>Nada.</p>\r\n<p>Just open up a new Excel spreadsheet. If you have multiple writers, you can share the sheet using Google drive.</p>\r\n<p>Start with four columns &ndash; Publishing Date, Title, Keyword and Notes.</p>\r\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img class=\"wp-image-132740\" src=\"https://neilpatel.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Editorial-calendar-example-how-to-start-a-blog-700x187.webp\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" srcset=\"https://neilpatel.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Editorial-calendar-example-how-to-start-a-blog-700x187.webp 700w, https://neilpatel.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Editorial-calendar-example-how-to-start-a-blog-350x93.webp 350w, https://neilpatel.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Editorial-calendar-example-how-to-start-a-blog-768x205.webp 768w, https://neilpatel.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Editorial-calendar-example-how-to-start-a-blog.webp 927w\" alt=\"Example editorial calendar for How to Start a Blog\" width=\"700\" height=\"187\" /></figure>\r\n<p>Your needs might be different than mine, so feel free to add additional columns as needed. Common additions might include &ldquo;Author,&rdquo;&rdquo;Category&rdquo; and &ldquo;Persona.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>The simpler you keep it, the easier it will be to digest and follow.</p>\r\n<p>Look through your calendar on your iPhone, Android, or the one hanging on your fridge. How often can you post?</p>\r\n<p>Monthly? Weekly? Daily?</p>\r\n<p>Be conservative with your goals, because consistently missing deadlines can lead to quitting altogether.</p>\r\n<p>Next, go through the answers that you came up with in your brainstorming session and add them under the &ldquo;Title&rdquo; column.</p>\r\n<p>Your titles don&rsquo;t need to be perfect yet. Throw in a working headline that you can spruce up before publishing.</p>\r\n<p>Sometimes, the best headlines come after you&rsquo;ve written your article. You&rsquo;ll have a crystal clear picture of what your story is about and who it is for.</p>\r\n<p>The &ldquo;Keyword&rdquo; column is intended for SEO purposes. If you&rsquo;re targeting&nbsp;<a href=\"https://neilpatel.com/blog/right-keywords-seo/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">specific keyword phrases</a>&nbsp;that you&rsquo;d like to rank for, add those in there.</p>\r\n<p>If nothing comes to mind, you can do some keyword research later on.</p>\r\n<p>Finally, there&rsquo;s the &ldquo;Notes&rdquo; column.</p>\r\n<p>This section is a perfect place to write down brilliant ideas that come to mind. Notes also act as a great tool to stay focused on the topic at hand and tackle it coherently.</p>\r\n<p>You should be able to write up a set of 25 blog post topics with deadlines that you&rsquo;re confident about keeping.</p>\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s almost half a year&rsquo;s worth of blog posts for a weekly writer.</p>\r\n<p>Okay. You have the editorial, but you&rsquo;re still&nbsp;<em>missing the calendar.</em></p>\r\n<p>Go to Google Calendars and set up a new calendar.

Maybe there’s something hidden in our subconscious mind that needs to test our courage against the troubles in our ancient evolutionary past. Also, we like the excitement of depending on our senses to keep mutants or zombies out of our way.', '<h3><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">1.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://greenhell-game.com/\">Green Hell</a></span></h3>\r\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Green Hell a undiscovered Amazon rainforest, in which you are left to defend yourself after being abandoned with nothing but a radio. Gameplay centers about caring for natural needs like building shelter, finding food, dangerous animals, and avoiding disease. A unique addition to this game is a Body Inspection Mode that enables you to manage your physical body by eliminating parasites, diagnosing yourself, and applying bandages. However, Green Hell is an equally psychological thriller since you will also need to control your psychological condition against an environment of isolation and other insanity-inducing environmental forces.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><iframe title=\"Green Hell - Launch Trailer | PS4\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/QF28UilEFcU?feature=oembed\" width=\"1170\" height=\"658\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></iframe></p>\r\n<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">&nbsp;</span></strong></p>\r\n<h3><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">2.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://endnightgames.com/games/the-forest\">The Fores</a>t</span></h3>\r\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The Forest welcomes you to a mysterious island populated by mutants that like to make you their next meal. The densely forested island and incorporates resources, both naturally occurring on the island and that you can retrieve from your crashed airplane. Survival involves managing the sources to build shelter and create weapons to battle with the mutants. Also, you have to ward off sickness and handle fire to stay warm and cook your food. Surviving is extra challenging because you will be hunted at night by the mutants, so solid shelter and traps are crucial to your survival.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><iframe title=\"The Forest &ndash; PSX 2017: Multiplayer Trailer | PS4\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8KXfxHujIAA?feature=oembed\" width=\"1170\" height=\"658\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></iframe></p>\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n<h3><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">3.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/games/fallout-4\">Fallout 4</a></span></h3>\r\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Fallout is a must-have for fans of the genre. You play as an unfortunate survivor of a catastrophic thermonuclear war. Alive only because you got cryogenically frozen in an undercovered nuclear fallout shelter. Unfortunately, your son got kidnapped, so you must wander out into the vast decaying wastelands in search of him, scavenging supplies and weaponry and fighting packs of enemies like Mole Rats and Raiders and Super Mutants.

You play the character of a crew member of a spaceship that has fallen on an unfamiliar and remote planet, with one big problem there&rsquo;s no land in view, just the ocean.

The objective of Don&rsquo;t Starve is to craft, hunt, farm, and research things that are valuable so that you can eat and sustain in a different little world full of strange creatures and wonders. But, there are no directions, no hand-holding, and no help. It would benefit if you relied on your wit to make it through the game.
